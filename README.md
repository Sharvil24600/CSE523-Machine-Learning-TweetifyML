# CSE523-Machine-Learning-TweetifyML

 ## Introduction
 
 This project is an aim to create a model for companies and organizations that can deliver better experiences to their customers across the world on the basis of thoughts, beliefs, and mindset of customers themselves through their tweets tweeted on the world-famous microblogging platform Twitter which entertains around 6000 tweets per second. Opinion of people matters a lot to analyze how the propagation of information impacts the lives in a large-scale network like Twitter. Sentiment Analysis of the tweets  decides the polarity and inclination of a vast population towards a specific topic, item. person or entity. The ultimate goal is to analyze twitter data to perform algorithms and predict better results through Machine Learning models to evaluate a company or brand in real-time on the basis of the past datasets as well as live data streaming and for changes in their business models, detect anomalies with alert and for enforcing public engagement.

## Datasets

We got our data using Twitter API to retrieve tweets from the time frame we want to.

Our Twitter api access credentials are :-


API_KEY = 'sOXlGaI6SZqFrBFceJgYueGqy'
API_SECRET_KEY = 'fTSCBCIE0IKU0S80dV2BD84ldKTfRxYbHhQRJSGNk7xVWWzb8J'


ACCESS_TOKEN = '780457425836978176-AHOuNzv2fHAWi5trXKdHytBphCss1kk'
API_TOKEN_SECRET = 'm9xhGlhw7Q10O9rdgaVbQFzge4JagIZZsFKi1RZ912BzB'
